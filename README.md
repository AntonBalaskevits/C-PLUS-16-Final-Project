### Solution
- I decided to execute as indicated in the conditions. First, registration must be completed, and then you can use the password and login to use the chat or send messages to a specific user. At least two users must be registered, if this condition is not met then an exception is thrown. I also tried to provide an exception in cases where an incorrect password or login was entered, and a registration check in the case when user whit the same login is already registered.
